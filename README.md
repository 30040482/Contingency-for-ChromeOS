A window will appear asking if you'd like to allow non-super users to capture packets.

If you did not allow non-super users to capture packets, you will not have permission to capture packets on any network interface.

Reconfigure Wireshark to enable the sufficient permissions.

    sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common

Select 'yes' in re-enable non-super user permissions.

Add users with usermod.
